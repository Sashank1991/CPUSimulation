CPU Simulation
Project descriptionBuilt CPU simulator with Linux as platform and C as programming language.
The design involves Memory organization and Instructions set implementation.

Configuration:
1. 2KB of memory( 512KB for Bootloader, 512KB for Instruction memory, 1024KB for Data Memory.) .
2. 16 32 bit general purpose registers.
3. 7 special purpose registers.
4. 32 bit word size.

Further implementations utilizing this CPU are as follows.
1. Loops
2. Function Calls
3. Recursive Binary Search.

Instructions for executing above implementations are provided in Instructons.txt file
